## Firewalls

### **What is a Firewall?**  

A **firewall** is a **network security device** or software that monitors and controls **incoming and outgoing traffic** based on **security rules**. Think of it as the **gatekeeper** between your internal network and the outside world (internet), deciding which data packets are allowed to pass through and which ones are blocked.
It is more than just a barrier between networks. It inspects and controls traffic between **trusted and untrusted zones**. Over time, firewalls have evolved from basic **packet filters** to **stateful, application-aware systems** that provide **threat intelligence, deep packet inspection (DPI), and even malware prevention**.

### **Types of Firewalls (Basic detail)**

1. **Packet-Filtering Firewall (Stateless Firewall):**  
   - Inspects each packet individually without considering past traffic.
   - Uses **IP addresses, ports, and protocols** to filter traffic.
   - Simple but less effective against advanced attacks.  
   **Example:** Block traffic from `192.168.1.50` on port `80`.

2. **Stateful Firewall:**  
   - Tracks the **state of active connections** and makes decisions based on the connection history.
   - Offers better security compared to stateless firewalls.

3. **Proxy Firewall:**  
   - Acts as an **intermediary** between internal users and external services.
   - Filters traffic at the **application layer**.
   **Example:** A web proxy that monitors all HTTP requests and prevents access to malicious websites.

4. **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW):**  
   - Includes features like **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**, **Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)**, and **malware filtering**.
   - Works across multiple layers (from **network to application**).

5. **Cloud Firewalls:**  
   - Deployed in cloud environments, typically as **firewall-as-a-service (FaaS)**.
   **Example:** AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) filters web traffic on cloud applications.



### **Firewall Configuration – Example**

Here’s an example of configuring **firewall rules** using `iptables` in Linux.

### **1. Block Incoming Traffic on Port 22 (SSH):**
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```

### **2. Allow HTTP (Port 80) and HTTPS (Port 443):**
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```


### **Firewall Limitations**

- Cannot protect against **internal attacks** (like a compromised insider).
- Ineffective against some attacks like **phishing** or **social engineering**.
- Requires continuous **monitoring and rule updates** to remain effective.


### **Python Example: Simple Packet Filtering Firewall**

Here’s a **Python script** using `scapy` to block traffic from a specific IP.

1. Install **Scapy**:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

2. Create a script to block traffic:
   ```python
   from scapy.all import *

   BLOCKED_IP = "192.168.1.5"

   def packet_filter(packet):
       if IP in packet and packet[IP].src == BLOCKED_IP:
           print(f"Blocked packet from {BLOCKED_IP}")
           return False  # Drop the packet
       else:
           return True  # Allow the packet

   sniff(prn=packet_filter, store=False)
   ```

### **Firewall Types – Beyond Basics**

Firewalls come in various forms, each suited for specific security needs. They differ in how they inspect traffic, operate at different layers of the OSI model, and how they are deployed in a network. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of all firewall types, from basic to advanced, along with real-world examples. 

---

### 1. **Packet-Filtering Firewall**  
A **packet-filtering firewall** inspects **individual packets** based on predefined rules related to IP addresses, protocols, and ports. It works at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** and **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)** of the OSI model.

#### **How it Works:**  
- It allows or blocks traffic based on:
  - **Source/Destination IP**
  - **Protocol** (TCP/UDP)
  - **Ports** (e.g., HTTP uses port 80)

#### **Example:**
A packet-filtering firewall allows HTTP (port 80) traffic but blocks FTP (port 21).  
**Linux iptables command:**
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # Allow HTTP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP     # Block FTP
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Simple and fast.
- Low resource consumption.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Cannot inspect packet contents.
- Vulnerable to attacks like **IP spoofing**.

---

### 2. **Stateful Inspection Firewall**  
Stateful firewalls track the **state of active connections** and make decisions based on the connection state. This is an enhancement over packet-filtering firewalls.

#### **How it Works:**  
- It monitors the **entire session** (like TCP handshakes) and ensures only **legitimate packets** are allowed back in.

#### **Example:**
A stateful firewall will allow **only the return packets** of an outbound request (e.g., accessing a website).  
**iptables example:**
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Prevents **unauthorized packets** from entering.
- More secure than packet-filtering firewalls.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Requires more resources to maintain state tables.
- May introduce latency in high-traffic environments.

---

#### 3. **Application Layer Firewall (Proxy Firewall)**  
An **application-layer firewall** works at **Layer 7 (Application Layer)** of the OSI model. It can inspect **application-specific protocols** such as HTTP, SMTP, or DNS. 

#### **How it Works:**  
- It acts as a **proxy**, intercepting all traffic between users and external services.
- Inspects **data payloads** to detect malicious content like **SQL injections**.

#### **Example:**
A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** protects a website from malicious requests like **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** and **SQL injection** attacks.

#### **Advantages:**
- Understands application protocols.
- Can block malicious content at the application level.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Requires more processing power.
- Can slow down network traffic.

---

### 4. **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**  
An **NGFW** integrates **traditional firewall capabilities** with advanced features like **deep packet inspection (DPI)**, **intrusion prevention systems (IPS)**, and **threat intelligence feeds**.

#### **How it Works:**  
- It analyzes not only packet headers but also **payload content**.
- NGFWs can decrypt and inspect **SSL/TLS** traffic.

#### **Example:**
A **Palo Alto NGFW** can block traffic from known malicious IPs and detect **zero-day malware**.

#### **Advantages:**
- Combines multiple security features.
- Provides **granular control** over applications.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Expensive and resource-intensive.
- Complex to configure and maintain.

---

### 5. **Unified Threat Management (UTM) Firewall**  
A **UTM firewall** offers a **comprehensive suite of security services** in a single device, including:
- **Firewall**
- **VPN**
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
- **Antivirus**
- **Content Filtering**

#### **How it Works:**  
- Suitable for **small to medium-sized businesses** that need an all-in-one security solution.

#### **Example:**  
A UTM device, such as **Fortinet FortiGate**, provides a **firewall, web filtering, and VPN** in one package.

#### **Advantages:**
- Easy to manage with a single interface.
- Cost-effective for small networks.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- May not scale well for large enterprises.
- All services run on one device, creating a single point of failure.

---

### 6. **Virtual Firewall (Cloud Firewall)**  
A **virtual firewall** is software-based and designed for **cloud environments** like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It protects **virtual machines and cloud workloads**.

### **How it Works:**  
- Filters traffic between **cloud instances**.
- Integrates with **cloud-native tools** for security automation.

#### **Example:**
An **AWS Security Group** acts as a virtual firewall for cloud-based EC2 instances.

#### **Advantages:**
- Flexible and easy to scale.
- Optimized for cloud environments.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Limited by cloud provider features.
- Requires cloud security expertise.

---

### 7. **Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewall**  
A **NAT firewall** modifies the source or destination IP addresses of packets passing through it. It hides **internal network addresses** from the public internet.

#### **How it Works:**  
- Converts **private IP addresses** to **public IPs** when communicating with the internet.

#### **Example:**
A home router with NAT firewall allows multiple devices to access the internet through a **single public IP**.

#### **Advantages:**
- Provides basic protection by hiding internal IPs.
- Reduces the need for public IPs.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Cannot inspect packet payloads.
- Limited in blocking sophisticated attacks.

---

### 8. **Cloud Firewall (Firewall as a Service – FWaaS)**  
Cloud firewalls are **fully managed services** provided by cloud providers. They protect **cloud-hosted applications and services** from threats.

#### **Example:**  
- **Azure Firewall** monitors and controls traffic to Azure-hosted resources.
- **AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)** protects web applications from DDoS attacks.

#### **Advantages:**
- Managed and maintained by the provider.
- Scalable based on traffic load.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Dependent on the cloud provider’s infrastructure.
- May introduce latency if not properly configured.

---

### 9. **Hardware vs. Software Firewalls**

| **Type**       | **Description**                               | **Example**                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Hardware**   | Physical devices deployed at the network edge. | Cisco ASA, Fortinet FortiGate    |
| **Software**   | Installed on hosts or virtual environments.     | Windows Defender Firewall, pfSense |

---

### **Firewall Use Cases in Different Scenarios**

1. **Enterprise Network:**
   - Uses a **next-generation firewall (NGFW)** to control both internal and external traffic.

2. **Small Business:**
   - Deploys a **UTM firewall** to protect a small network from malware and phishing attacks.

3. **Cloud Application:**
   - Uses an **AWS WAF** to protect a website from DDoS attacks.

---

### **Firewall Zones and Policies**

#### 1. **Network Zones**  
- Firewalls divide networks into **zones** such as:
  - **Trusted Zone:** Internal network (e.g., corporate LAN).
  - **Untrusted Zone:** Public networks like the Internet.
  - **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ):** Hosts public-facing services (e.g., web server).

#### 2. **Firewall Policies**  
- **Implicit Deny:** Block all traffic by default unless explicitly allowed.  
  **Example:**
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP  # Set default policy to DROP
  ```
- **Allow-List/Block-List:** Restrict or allow traffic based on **IP, protocol, or port**.

---

### **Firewall Rules Example in Linux (iptables)**

Here’s a more **advanced example** where we implement a set of firewall rules:

1. **Allow SSH (Port 22) from a specific IP:**
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 203.0.113.10 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
   ```

2. **Block all outgoing traffic except DNS (port 53) and HTTP (port 80):**
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
   sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
   sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
   ```

---

### **Advanced Concepts: Firewall Logging and Monitoring**

#### 1. **Firewall Logs**  
- Firewalls generate logs for **every connection attempt** and security event.  
  **Example Log Entry (iptables):**
  ```
  IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=12:34:56:78 SRC=192.168.1.5 DST=8.8.8.8 LEN=60 PROTO=TCP DPT=80 ACCEPT
  ```

#### 2. **SIEM Integration**  
- Firewall logs are sent to **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** platforms (like **Splunk or ELK**) for real-time monitoring and analysis.

---

### **Firewall and VPN Integration**

Firewalls often **integrate with VPNs** (Virtual Private Networks) to enforce policies for encrypted connections.  
**Example:** A company firewall allows VPN users access to internal resources, but blocks internet access through the VPN.

---

### **Firewall and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

Modern firewalls often **integrate IDS/IPS systems** to detect malicious activity like:

- **Port scanning** attempts.
- **Brute force attacks** on SSH or RDP.
  
**Command Example for Detecting Port Scanning (Linux):**
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m recent --name ssh_attack --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 -j DROP
```

---
---

### **Real-World Firewall Scenario: College Network Setup**

Let’s design a **firewall scenario for a college network**.

### **Network Setup**
- **Zone 1:** Administration network.
- **Zone 2:** Student network.
- **DMZ:** Hosts the college **website and email server**.
- **Internet Gateway:** Connects the campus to the internet.

### **Firewall Policy Implementation**
1. **Admin Network:**  
   - Allow RDP (port 3389) and SSH (port 22) only from the admin department.
   - Block all internet access except to the intranet.

2. **Student Network:**  
   - Allow only HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443) for web browsing.
   - Block all peer-to-peer traffic (like torrents).

3. **DMZ (Public-Facing Servers):**  
   - Allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
   - Block all other ports.

## **How Firewalls Work – Detailed Explanation**

### **How Firewalls Control Traffic**

Firewalls inspect **packets** (small chunks of data transmitted over a network) and allow or block them based on specific **rules or policies**. These rules are designed to regulate traffic according to:  
- **Source/Destination IP Address**  
- **Port Numbers** (e.g., HTTP = port 80, SSH = port 22)  
- **Protocol** (e.g., TCP, UDP)  
- **Packet States** (e.g., new, established, or related connections)

A **firewall acts as a security checkpoint** between internal (private) and external (public) networks, examining every incoming or outgoing packet. It uses the following methods to inspect packets:

---

### **Firewall Packet Flow – Step-by-Step Example**

Let’s walk through a **real-world packet flow scenario** involving a client on an internal network trying to access a web server on the internet. 

**Scenario:**
- **Client IP (Private):** 192.168.1.10  
- **Firewall’s External Interface (Public IP):** 203.0.113.1  
- **Web Server (Public IP):** 198.51.100.5 (on port 80 – HTTP)  

Here’s the packet journey through the firewall:

---

#### **Step 1: Outbound Request from the Client**

1. **Client sends a request** to open a web page from the web server (198.51.100.5:80).  
2. The **client’s packet details**:
   ```
   Source IP: 192.168.1.10
   Destination IP: 198.51.100.5
   Source Port: 50545 (random high port)
   Destination Port: 80 (HTTP)
   Protocol: TCP
   ```

---

#### **Step 2: Packet Reaches the Firewall (NAT Translation)**

1. **Firewall inspects the packet header** and identifies that:
   - It is an **outbound packet** from an internal IP (192.168.1.10).
   - The destination is the **internet** (public IP: 198.51.100.5).  

2. The firewall performs **Network Address Translation (NAT)**:  
   - **Replaces the client’s private IP** (192.168.1.10) with the **firewall’s public IP** (203.0.113.1).  
   - Updates the **source port** for tracking the connection later.  

3. **Modified packet** (post-NAT):
   ```
   Source IP: 203.0.113.1
   Destination IP: 198.51.100.5
   Source Port: 49152 (NAT-assigned port)
   Destination Port: 80 (HTTP)
   Protocol: TCP
   ```

---

#### **Step 3: Firewall Applies Outbound Rules**

1. **Firewall checks its outbound rules** to see if traffic from **internal IP 192.168.1.10 to port 80** is allowed.  
   - If the policy allows it, the firewall **forwards the packet** to the web server.
   - If blocked, the **firewall drops the packet**, and the request is denied.

---

#### **Step 4: Web Server Sends the Response**

1. The **web server** processes the request and sends a **response** (e.g., HTML content of the requested web page).  
2. **Response packet details**:
   ```
   Source IP: 198.51.100.5
   Destination IP: 203.0.113.1
   Source Port: 80 (HTTP)
   Destination Port: 49152 (NAT-assigned port)
   Protocol: TCP
   ```

---

#### **Step 5: Firewall Receives the Response**

1. **Firewall matches the response packet** with the state table entry it created earlier (tracking the client’s connection).  
   - This is possible because the firewall keeps a **state table** for every active connection.

2. It **reverses the NAT translation**:
   - **Replaces the public IP (203.0.113.1)** with the **original private IP** (192.168.1.10).
   - **Restores the original port** (50545).

3. **Modified packet** (post-reverse NAT):
   ```
   Source IP: 198.51.100.5
   Destination IP: 192.168.1.10
   Source Port: 80 (HTTP)
   Destination Port: 50545
   Protocol: TCP
   ```

---

#### **Step 6: Firewall Applies Inbound Rules**

1. **Firewall checks inbound rules** to confirm that:
   - This response matches an **existing, established session**.
   - It is **allowed to enter** the internal network.

2. If the response matches an **allowed session**, the firewall **forwards the packet** to the client.

---

#### **Step 7: Client Receives the Web Page**  
The **client receives the response packet** with the requested web page and displays it in the browser. The **TCP session** between the client and the web server continues until either side closes it.

---

## **Firewall Packet Inspection Techniques**

1. **Stateless Filtering:**  
   - Inspects individual packets independently.
   - Example: **Packet-filtering firewalls**.

2. **Stateful Inspection:**  
   - Tracks the **state of connections** and only allows return packets for valid sessions.
   - Example: **Stateful firewalls** like Cisco ASA.

3. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):**  
   - Analyzes the **payload** (content) of packets.
   - Example: **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)**.

---

### **Firewall Flow Chart Example**

Here’s a simple flow of how a firewall decides whether to allow or block a packet:

1. **Inbound Packet Arrives** ⟶ Check Rules  
2. **Is IP Whitelisted?**  
   - **Yes** ⟶ Allow Packet  
   - **No** ⟶ Check Protocol and Port  
3. **Is Protocol Allowed?**  
   - **Yes** ⟶ Allow Packet  
   - **No** ⟶ Block Packet and Log Event  

---

### **Example: Python Simulation of a Simple Packet Filter Firewall**

Below is a **Python example** of a simple packet filter that allows only HTTP traffic (port 80) and blocks others:

```python
def packet_filter(packet):
    allowed_port = 80  # HTTP traffic only

    if packet['port'] == allowed_port:
        return "Packet Allowed"
    else:
        return "Packet Blocked"

# Example packet
packet1 = {'ip': '192.168.1.10', 'port': 80, 'protocol': 'TCP'}
packet2 = {'ip': '192.168.1.20', 'port': 22, 'protocol': 'TCP'}

print(packet_filter(packet1))  # Output: Packet Allowed
print(packet_filter(packet2))  # Output: Packet Blocked
```

---
---

## **Firewall Policies and Rules**

---

### **What are Firewall Policies and Rules?**

- **Firewall Policies**: A high-level **set of guidelines or rules** that dictate how a firewall controls network traffic. Policies are often created to reflect security objectives (e.g., “Allow only HTTP traffic to public servers”).  
- **Firewall Rules**: **Specific instructions** within the policy that define **conditions** for allowing or blocking traffic (e.g., source IP, destination port, protocol).

The **policies provide the framework**, while **rules are the granular instructions** used to implement that policy.

---

### **Key Concepts in Firewall Rules**

1. **Action**: Whether to **allow** or **deny** traffic.
2. **Source IP Address**: The **IP address or range** where the traffic originates.
3. **Destination IP Address**: The **target IP address** or network.
4. **Protocol**: Specifies which **protocol** is used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
5. **Port Number**: Indicates the **service port** (e.g., HTTP uses port 80).
6. **Direction**: Whether the rule applies to **inbound** or **outbound** traffic.
7. **Stateful/Stateless**: Determines if the rule tracks the **state of connections** (stateful) or applies independently to each packet (stateless).
8. **Time Constraints**: Some rules can be active only **during certain hours** (e.g., allow remote access only during work hours).

---

### **Basic vs. Advanced Firewall Rules**

| **Basic Firewall Rules** | **Advanced Firewall Rules** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Allow or block specific ports | Filter traffic by IP ranges, protocols, and time of day |
| Inbound or outbound rules | Application-layer filtering |
| Simple packet filtering | Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for payload scanning |

---

### **Example of Firewall Policies and Rules in Real Life**

**Scenario:**  
- A company wants to secure its internal network while allowing necessary services (e.g., **web, email, remote access**) to function.  
- **Firewall Policy Objective**:  
  1. Allow web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) from outside to the web server.
  2. Block all unauthorized services from the internet.
  3. Allow employees to access the internet but block social media during office hours.

#### **Sample Firewall Policy and Rules Table**

| **Policy Name**       | **Source IP**        | **Destination IP**    | **Protocol** | **Port** | **Action**  | **Time**           |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| Allow Web Traffic     | Any                  | Web Server (10.0.0.5) | TCP         | 80, 443  | Allow       | Always             |
| Block Unauthorized    | Any                  | Internal Network      | Any         | Any      | Deny        | Always             |
| Allow Employee Access | Internal Network     | Any                   | TCP, UDP    | 80, 443  | Allow       | 9 AM - 5 PM        |
| Block Social Media    | Internal Network     | Social Media IPs      | TCP         | 80, 443  | Deny        | 9 AM - 5 PM (M-F)  |
| Remote Access         | Remote IP (203.0.113.1) | Internal Server (10.0.0.10) | TCP  | 22 (SSH) | Allow       | 6 PM - 8 AM (M-F) |

### **How to Implement Firewall Rules in Linux (Using `iptables`)**

Here’s an **example of configuring firewall rules** using `iptables` (a popular firewall tool in Linux).

### **Allow HTTP and HTTPS Traffic to Web Server**

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```

### **Block Unauthorized Access to Internal Network**

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 10.0.0.0/24 -j DROP
```

### **Allow SSH Access from a Specific IP**

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 203.0.113.1 -j ACCEPT
```

---

### **Best Practices for Firewall Rules and Policies**

1. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:**  
   - Allow only the necessary traffic. Deny everything else.

2. **Regularly Review Firewall Rules:**  
   - Remove outdated or unnecessary rules to avoid vulnerabilities.

3. **Use Stateful Inspection:**  
   - Track active connections to allow only expected return traffic.

4. **Log Denied Packets:**  
   - Maintain logs for blocked traffic to identify potential security threats.

5. **Apply Rules in the Correct Order:**  
   - Rules are usually processed in sequence. Make sure critical rules are applied first.

### **Firewall Best Practices for Advanced Users**

1. **Implement a Default-Deny Policy:**  
   Deny all traffic by default and allow only specific traffic that is necessary.
